# MaerklinMotorolaDecoder
Simple Maerklion Motorola Function/Signal/Magnet Decoder

This Arduino Project implements a simple Maerklin Motorola (2) MM2 Functio/Signal/Magnet Decoder. It uses the library (modified) https://github.com/mmame/MaerklinMotorola which was originally written by Michael H. (Laserlicht) (thanks!)

The Decoder also works on ATTiny85 so you can build very cheap MM2 decoders ;-)
